# Welcome

This application generates static sites from markdown using Go. To modify, please edit the markdown file in `content/index.md`. The generation is done through a Golang application that parses the markdown, wraps in a base HTML template found at `templates/base.html`, then outputs the result into the `public/`.

Once generated, the application will host the content at localhost on port 8080.

## Usage (Download and Run)

Select the appropriate package for your system.

Extract the files and modify to your liking. Be sure to execute `chmod +x path/to/executable` if running on Linux or Apple systems.

1. Modify the `index.md` file located in `content/`
2. If desired, modify the HTML file located in `templates/`
3. The application reads any CSS file named `style.css` in the `assets/` directory. If you don't wish to use The Monospace Web, simply replace the CSS with your own.
